So I tried very hard to do exercise and take vitamins and every two years take bone density check.  In 2017 bone density check showed my bone density dropped into osteoporosis range.  My internal medicine doctor prescribed Alendronate 70 mg per week, stared on December 2017. Alendronate stopped on October of 2021.  Because in the 4 years I take Alendronate, my low back discomfort get worse.  I visited bone metabolism doctor in hospital for special surgery.  This doctor find out that I can not absorb bisphosphonate orally.  So he changed to give me reclast infusion.  On December 15th, I received 5mg reclast infusion. I only need one infusion currently.  Two years later bone density check will decide next step. Usually one infusion is enough.  I donâ€™t have pain, but I can not bend, even just 30 second using vacuum I can not stand.
